### secured and monitored infrastructure

Three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.
Must have:
- 2 servers
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
- 1 set of application files (your code base)
- 1 database (MySQL)
